## Challenge

The site should consist of a homepage with a paginated list of posts in descending chronological order. Each post should show the title, description, and author, with a link to view the full post.

Creating a post should be a separate page with a simple form. Each post should have a title, description, and body. It should validate that all of these fields are filled out. The post should also have an author, which is automatically assigned as the signed in user. The author of a post should have the ability to edit and delete the post after creation.

You should be required to sign up for an account in order to create a post. For the purposes of this challenge, anyone can create an account and create a post. You can use a plug-and-play solution like devise if you want.
